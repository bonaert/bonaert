Hi, I'm Gregory Bonaert (you can call me Greg). Here you'll be able to learn with me about computer science and software development.
You'll find practical posts (with code) as I explore new themes such as aritificial intelligence, and the underlying maths when needed.

Since I understand things better when they're explained simply and with examples, I strive to make every post that way.

Hope you like it and if you have any comments contact me at <mailto:harokb@gmail.com>.
