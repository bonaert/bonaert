Hi, I'm Greg Bonaert, a computer science student from Brussels, Belgium. I write about computer science, my personal projects and my attempts to become 
a slightly better developer. If you're a developer, a maths-lover or just curious, join me in my explorations and learn with me.

I make every post as clear as possible, through lots of examples, clear code and the right amount of maths (a wall of maths isn't the best way to get readers).


Since being a developer is more than just about code, I'll also sometimes write about psychology, habits, tools and great books I recommend, if I think they can be useful or interesting to you. 


If you have any comments or just want to talk to me, contact me at <mailto:harokb@gmail.com>.
